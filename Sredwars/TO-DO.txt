TO-DO

1. Bed destruction system
	Bed cannot be destroyed by own team
	Bed cannot be blown up with TNT/fireballs
	Upon destruction:
		- chat reads "<Color> bed destroyed by <player>"
		- Team with that bed gets title saying "Bed destroyed!" subtitle "you will no longer respawn"
		- Team will no longer respawn -- instead of 5sec spectator mode upon death, permanent spectator mode

2. Blocks
	a. Wool
		4 iron ingots for 16 wool
		Shop for each team sells team color wool
		Breakable by fireballs, TNT
	b. Wood
		4 gold ingots for 16 wood
		breakable by fireballs, TNT
		slightly more blast resistant than wool
	c. brack proof grass
		12 iron ingots for 4 glass
		not breakable by fireballs, TNT
	d. end stone
		24 iron ingots for 12 end stone
		breakable by TNT but not by fireballs
		more blast resistant than wood
	e. ladders
		4 iron ingots for 16 ladders
		breakable by fireballs, TNT
		least blast resistance?
	f. obsidian
		4 emeralds for 4 obsidian
		not breakable by fireballs, TNT


3. Weapons

	Always lost upon death
	Stone sword: 10 iron
	Gold sword: 7 gold

	bows lost upon death as well
	8 arrows: 2 gold
	bow: 12 gold
	power I bow: 24 gold
	power I punch I bow: 6 emeralds

	default weapon: wood sword, cannot be lost upon death


4. Tools
	System to keep track of tool upgrades by player
	Upon death, tool downgraded one level
	Once wood pickaxe or axe is bought, cannot be lost

	Shears are permanent, 20 iron

	Wood pickaxe (Eff 1): 10 iron
	Iron pickaxe (Eff 2): 10 iron
	Gold pickaxe (Eff 3, Sharp 2): 3 gold
	Diamond pickaxe (Eff 3): 6 gold

	Wood axe (eff 1): 10 iron
	Stone axe (Eff 1): 10 iron
	Iron axe (eff 2): 3 gold
	Diamond axe (eff 3): 6 gold

5. Potions

	Shopkeeper sells
	Speed 2, 45 sec: 1 emerald
	Jump 5, 45 sec: 1 emerald
	Invis, 30 sec: 2 emeralds

	no particles for all 3

	Invis mechanics
	- automatically remove armor upon invis (to be totally invis)
	- automatically replace armor if hit during invis (cancel invis) or when invis runs out

6. Utilities

	Shopkeeper sells

	Golden apple: 3 gold
		- no modifications
	Bed bug (snowball): 40 iron
		- snowball spawns silverfish upon impact
		- attacks only enemy teams, not team that threw it
		- dies after 15 sec automatically
	Dream defender (iron golem): 120 iron
		- no golem spawn egg so do polar bear spawn egg that spawns an iron golem
		- only attacks enemy teams, not team that placed it
		- dies after 240 sec automatically
	Fireball (fire charge): 40 iron
		- right click to shoot in straight line
		- only destroys certain placeable blocks (wool, wood)
		- player knockback
		- maybe could be done by spawning invisible dispenser on an armor stand at player eyes and shoot fireball? or perhaps a moving invis armor stand with a lit fire charge in hand? idk
	TNT: 8 gold
		- one idea: creeper spawn egg that spawns lit TNT with a fuse of 50 ticks
		- if possible, make it actual TNT that is instantly lit when placed
		- only destroys certain blocks listed far above
		- increase knockback to players and decrease damage to players
	Ender pearl: 4 emeralds
		- normal ender pearl
		- if possible, make it not apply any damage when used
		- maybe give players maximum resistance for 1 second when it lands? use vector notation to see how close it is to hitting a block and trigger resistance + regen
	Water bucket: 6 gold
		- empty water bucket disappears from inventory once water is placed, cannot be picked up again
	Bridge egg (egg): 1 emerald
		- egg that creates a wool block bridge along the thrown egg's path in the color of the team that threw it
	Sponge x4: 6 gold
		- no modifications (do we even need to put this in? it's never used)
	Pop-up tower (chest): 24 gold
		- pops up into a tower when placed
		- hmmmm

7. Diamond upgrades 
	Sharpened swords: 8 diamonds
		- sharpened swords applied to all swords and axes on team
	Reinforced armor: 5, 10, 20, 30 diamonds (levels 1, 2, 3, 4)
		- applies protection to all armor on team
	Maniac miner: 4, 6 diamonds (levels 1, 2)
		- gives haste effect 1 or 2 to all team members
	Iron forge: 4 diamonds
	Golden forge: 8 diamonds
	Emerald forge: 12 diamonds
		- begin spawning emeralds
	Molten forge: 16 diamonds
	Heal pool: 3 diamonds
		- regen 1 around islands
	Traps: It's a Trap! ; Counter-offensive trap ; Alarm Trap ; Miner Fatigue Trap (1 diamond)
		- if possible, each extra trap (up to 3 total) costs 1 extra diamond
	No need to create dragon buff or sudden death imo

8. Trap logic
	Triggered if enemy player comes within 8(?) blocks of bed; affects only 1 player at a time?
	Lasts 10 seconds
	It's a Trap!: Blindness, slowness to attackers
	Miner Fatigue: miner fatigue to attackers
	counteroffensive: jump boost 2, speed 2 to defending team
	alarm trap: removes invis and sets off alarm sound

	trap disappears after being triggered
	No. of traps decreases by one
	if incoming player has magic milk effect, do not trigger trap
		magic milk could be substituted for an actual potion effect, like fire resistance or something to make it easier to detect if a player has it
		or maybe drinking magic milk sets off a 45 sec timer with a scoreboard 


9. Death logic
	- when player falls below certain Y level:
		- teleport to top of map
		- set gamemode to spectator
		- "You died!" title
		- 5 second respawn countdown
		- respawn right in front of forge of base
	death messages are color coded


	If bed is destroyed
		- no title or countdown and no respawn
		- would it be possible to create the compass tp spectator system?
		- append FINAL KILL! in aqua to the end of the death message


10. Armor
	- all players start with leather armor
	- armor upgrades are permanent and stay after death
	- all armor has protection level dictated by diamond upgrades
	- Chainmail armor: 40 iron
	- Iron armor: 12 gold
	- Diamond armor: 6 emeralds

	Players that buy chain/iron/dia armor get tagged as such
	Constantly running replaceitem command to set armor.legs and armor.feet to chain/iron/diamond
